ABOUT PROJECT:
This web application allows users to log in, sign up, browse a food menu, and complete a checkout process with their selected items. Developed with React.js, Express, MongoDB, and Node.js, it features a user-friendly interface styled with the Bootstrap-dark-5 CSS framework. The application interacts with APIs hosted locally and manages data through MongoDB collections and documents. It ensures security by using Bcrypt.js for password hashing and JWT tokens for authorization. Additionally, the search bar functionality is enhanced using React.js filters, enabling users to easily locate specific food items.
